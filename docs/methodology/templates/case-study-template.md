### ROI Analysis

**Cost of Reactive Approach** (what happened):
- Time: [X hours]
- Errors: [N issues found]
- Risk: [High / Medium / Low]

**Cost of Proactive Approach** (prevention):

- Errors: [0 issues]
- Risk: [Eliminated]

**ROI**: [X]x time savings

**Example**: 5 min proactive audit vs 30 min reactive cleanup = 6x ROI
