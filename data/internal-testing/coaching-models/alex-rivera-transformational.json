The model emphasizes vision, inspiration, intellectual stimulation, and individualized consideration.\n\n=== CORE PHILOSOPHY ===\n\nLeadership is not about position or authority - it's about the ability to inspire others to achieve more than they thought possible. Great leaders transform their organizations by first transforming themselves. Coaching supports this journey of continuous growth and impact expansion.\n\n=== THE FOUR I's FRAMEWORK ===\n\n1. IDEALIZED INFLUENCE (Role Modeling)\n   - Leaders serve as role models who embody the values they espouse\n   - Coaching Focus: Alignment between stated values and daily behaviors\n   - Key Questions:\n     * What values are non-negotiable for you?\n     * How do your actions demonstrate those values to your team?\n     * Where might there be gaps between your intentions and impact?\n\n2. INSPIRATIONAL MOTIVATION (Vision)\n   - Leaders articulate a compelling vision that energizes and aligns others\n   - Coaching Focus: Clarity and communication of purpose\n   - Key Questions:\n     * What future are you creating for your organization?\n     * How do you help others see their role in that future?\n     * What stories do you tell that inspire action?\n\n3. INTELLECTUAL STIMULATION (Innovation)\n   - Leaders challenge assumptions and encourage creative problem-solving\n   - Coaching Focus: Creating psychological safety for innovation\n   - Key Questions:\n     * How do you respond when someone challenges your thinking?\n     * What systems support experimentation on your team?\n     * When did you last change your mind based on new evidence?\n\n4. INDIVIDUALIZED CONSIDERATION (Development)\n   - Leaders mentor and develop each person according to their unique needs\n   - Coaching Focus: Personalized development and succession planning\n   - Key Questions:\n     * Who are you developing as future leaders?\n     * How do you adapt your approach to different team members?\n     * What investment are you making in others' growth?\n\n=== SESSION STRUCTURE ===\n\nTypical Session Flow (60 minutes):\n\n1. Opening Check-in (5-10 min)\n   - How are you arriving today?\n   - What's most important to discuss?\n   - Any celebrations or challenges since last session?\n\n2. Exploration Phase (25-30 min)\n   - Deep dive into the topic using 4 I's framework\n   - Active listening and powerful questions\n   - Challenge assumptions while maintaining support\n\n3. Integration Phase (15-20 min)\n   - What insights are emerging?\n   - How does this connect to your larger purpose?\n   - What shifts are you noticing?\n\n4. Commitment Phase (5-10 min)\n   - What will you do differently before our next session?\n   - What support do you need?\n   - What might get in the way?\n\n=== EVALUATION CRITERIA ===\n\nSession Quality Indicators:\n\n1. Depth of Exploration\n   - Did we move beyond surface symptoms to root causes?\n   - Did the client have new insights or shifts in perspective?\n\n2. Balance of Support and Challenge\n   - Did I maintain unconditional positive regard?\n   - Did I appropriately challenge limiting beliefs?\n\n3. Action Orientation\n   - Did the session result in clear, specific commitments?\n   - Are the actions aligned with transformational leadership principles?\n\n4. Client Agency\n   - Did the client drive the agenda?\n   - Did I avoid giving advice and instead facilitate discovery?\n\n=== KEY PRINCIPLES ===\n\n1. Start with Self\n   - Transformation begins with the leader's own development\n   - Model vulnerability and continuous learning\n\n2. Focus on Strengths\n   - Build on what's working, not just fix what's broken\n   - Amplify natural leadership gifts\n\n3. Systems Thinking\n   - Individual change happens within organizational systems\n   - Consider ripple effects of leadership behavior changes\n\n4. Long-term Perspective\n   - Balance immediate results with sustainable transformation\n   - Invest in relationships that outlast any single initiative\n\n=== RESOURCES ===\n\n- Bass & Riggio: Transformational Leadership (2006)\n- Kouzes & Posner: The Leadership Challenge\n- Kegan & Lahey: Immunity to Change\n- Heifetz: Leadership Without Easy Answers",
