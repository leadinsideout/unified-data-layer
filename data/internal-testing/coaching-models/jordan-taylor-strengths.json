Grounded in positive psychology and strengths science, this approach helps leaders maximize their unique gifts while strategically managing areas of lesser talent.\n\n=== CORE PHILOSOPHY ===\n\nEvery person has unique talents - patterns of thought, feeling, and behavior that can be productively applied. Great leaders know their strengths, lead from those strengths, and build teams that complement their natural talents. Weakness-fixing leads to adequacy; strength-building leads to excellence.\n\n=== THE STRENGTHS ADVANTAGE FRAMEWORK ===\n\n1. AWARENESS (Know Your Talents)\n   - Identify and name your natural talents\n   - Understand how talents show up in different contexts\n   - Recognize strength overuse and underuse\n   - Coaching Focus: Deep talent exploration and pattern recognition\n   - Key Questions:\n     * What activities make you lose track of time?\n     * What do others consistently come to you for?\n     * When do you feel most energized at work?\n\n2. APPLICATION (Use Strengths Daily)\n   - Find opportunities to use strengths every day\n   - Align role and responsibilities to natural talents\n   - Create strength-based goals and development plans\n   - Coaching Focus: Practical strength application strategies\n   - Key Questions:\n     * How can you do more of what you do best?\n     * Where are you fighting your nature in your current role?\n     * What tasks could you redesign to better fit your strengths?\n\n3. AMPLIFICATION (Maximize Impact)\n   - Invest in strengths to turn talents into true expertise\n   - Build partnerships that complement your weaknesses\n   - Create team cultures that celebrate diverse strengths\n   - Coaching Focus: Strategic strength investment\n   - Key Questions:\n     * How could you invest 10% more in your top strength?\n     * Who has strengths where you have weaknesses?\n     * What would it look like if your whole team led from strength?\n\n=== SESSION STRUCTURE ===\n\nTypical Session Flow (60 minutes):\n\n1. Strength Spotlight (5-10 min)\n   - When did you feel most 'in the zone' recently?\n   - What strengths were you using?\n   - What conditions enabled that peak performance?\n\n2. Challenge Navigation (25-30 min)\n   - Explore current challenges through a strengths lens\n   - Identify where strengths could be better applied\n   - Address strength overuse or weakness interference\n\n3. Strength Strategy (15-20 min)\n   - Design strength-based approaches to challenges\n   - Identify complementary partners or resources\n   - Plan for sustainable strength application\n\n4. Strength Commitment (5-10 min)\n   - What specific strength will you leverage this week?\n   - What conditions will you create to enable that?\n   - How will you know if it's working?\n\n=== EVALUATION CRITERIA ===\n\nSession Quality Indicators:\n\n1. Strength Focus Ratio\n   - Did we spend 80%+ of session on strengths vs. weaknesses?\n   - Did we reframe weaknesses through a strength lens?\n\n2. Energy and Engagement\n   - Did the client light up when discussing their strengths?\n   - Did we maintain positive, possibility-focused energy?\n\n3. Practical Application\n   - Did we connect strengths to real workplace challenges?\n   - Are commitments strength-based and specific?\n\n4. Partnership Building\n   - Did we explore complementary relationships?\n   - Is the client building strength-diverse teams?\n\n=== KEY PRINCIPLES ===\n\n1. Lead with Strengths\n   - Start every conversation from strength, not deficit\n   - Assume positive intent and natural talent\n\n2. Manage Weaknesses, Don't Fix Them\n   - Weaknesses are managed, not transformed\n   - Partner, delegate, or design around weaknesses\n\n3. Diversity of Strengths = Team Excellence\n   - No one person has all strengths\n   - High-performing teams need complementary talents\n\n4. Investment Over Remediation\n   - Time invested in strengths yields exponential returns\n   - Fixing weaknesses yields diminishing returns\n\n=== COMMON STRENGTH THEMES ===\n\nStrategic Thinking Strengths:\n- Strategic, Futuristic, Ideation, Analytical, Input\n\nRelationship Building Strengths:\n- Relator, Empathy, Developer, Individualization, Connectedness\n\nInfluencing Strengths:\n- Command, Communication, Competition, Activator, Self-Assurance\n\nExecuting Strengths:\n- Achiever, Responsibility, Focus, Discipline, Deliberative\n\n=== RESOURCES ===\n\n- Clifton & Buckingham: Now, Discover Your Strengths\n- Rath: StrengthsFinder 2.0\n- Rath & Conchie: Strengths Based Leadership\n- Buckingham: Go Put Your Strengths to Work",
